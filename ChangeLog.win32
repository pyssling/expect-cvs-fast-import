	* Created the 'telco-tec-win32-branch' from the HEAD.

	* `Imported`, as it were, Gordon Chaffe's snap29.  The root
	directory is still 5.32.2, and the sub directories for generic,
	win, and unix are Gordon's 5.21-snap29.

	* Moved the 5.32.2 .man scripts into doc/

	* Plans include full `Stubs compliance` for both importing Tcl's
	and exporting itself.  expectlib is to be discarded as the direction
	problem with it needing core function COPIES is a maintenence
	nightmare.  When one will want the C library, it will be housed
	in the extension itself, the outside interface will not mention Tcl,
	but the inside usage will require the Tcl library.  This backward
	reverse loading issue is identical in the pattern the TclPlugin
	has, and similar to TclBlend as well.
