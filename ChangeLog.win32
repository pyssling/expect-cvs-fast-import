	* win/expWinSpawnClient.hpp:
	* win/expWinSpawnPipeClient.cpp:
		removed all use of Tcl from the slavedrv.  It was only being
		used for hash tables.  replaced them with std::map.  It's a bit
		fatter now, but i'll live.

	* win/expWinConsoleDebugger.cpp:
	* win/expWinConsoleDebugger.hpp:
		re-added use of tcl's hash tables, but this time using the

	* win/expWinSlave.hpp:
	* win/expWinSlaveMain.cpp:
	* win/expWinSlaveTrapDbg.cpp:
		Re-arranged headers.  The ConsoleDebugger class is now hidden

		hide it more correctly.

	* win/TclHash.hpp:
		Added a Top() and Next() for hash searches.

	* win/expWinSlaveMain.cpp:

	* win/TclHash.hpp:
		Wait a sec.  I'm not happy with the STL's map template.  It
		adds too much bloat.  Let's go back to Tcl's hash tables.

	* win/expWinDynloadTclStubs.c:
		we'll need this again.

	* win/expWinSlaveTrap.hpp:
